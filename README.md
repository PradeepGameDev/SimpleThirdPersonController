# Simple Third Person Controller

A Unity-based third-person character controller created entirely from scratch without relying on Unity's built-in character controller. This project is designed to provide developers with a foundational, fully customizable third-person control system for 3D games. It demonstrates how to build essential movement mechanics using only Unity's core components and C# scripting. Whether you're building an action-adventure game, an RPG, or any 3D project requiring character movement, this controller serves as a starting point for learning and development.
